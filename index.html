      <h2>"Colors"</h2>
      
      <h3>Structure</h3>
      <p>One the hosts introduces each topic they will cover, and how they will go about it. Then, a guest is introduced to share their knowledge/scientific findings with the audience. This is done through interview questions. It seems as though this was largely unedited, as questions like, "what did you say?" are left in the episode.</p>
      
      <h3>Who's doing the talking?</h3>
      <p>Mainly the hosts, plus whomever they have on as guests. In one instance, a guest played a recording he has of an experiment.  Here, a woman who was the "test subject" also speaks. As this plays, the guest narrates.</p>
      
      <h3>Is it Scripted?</h3>
      <p>It seems the introduction to each portion of the show is, as well as the end when they name what artist played what song. Everything else in between is not scripted though.</p>
      
      <h3>Is it based on Interviews?</h3>
      <p>Yes, mostly. While some of the show consists of the hosts bantering back and forth, the majority of the show is based on interviews with experts on color.</p>
      
      <h3>What Sound/Music elements are Present?</h3>
      <p>Throughout the show, there is music playing. Specifically, music with color in the title. Other than that, there are no sounds apart from voices.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div ID="wrapper">
      
    <h2>"Homecoming"</h2>
          
        <h3>Structure</h3>     
             <p>It reminded me a lot of an episode of "NCIS" or some other crime show. It bounces back and forth between scenes and offers little to no context at first. Soon, pieces of the story begin to fall together. Unlike a show like that though, the scene must be set with sounds rather than visual aspects. The episode ends with somewhat of a cliffhanger, as to entice the listener to listen to the next episode.</p>
             
             <h3>Who's doing the talking?</h3>
             <p>Different characters at different times in different scenes, but the plurality of speaking seems to be Heidi. Each scene consists mostly of a two-person conversation.</p>
             
             <h3>Is it Scripted?</h3>
             <p>It is totally scripted from start to finish. There is no improvisation whatsoever.</p>
             
             <h3>Is it based on Interviews?</h3>
            <p>While it is not based on interviews in the same way "Colors" was, the interview format does play a role. In the final section, Heidi is being interviewed, or rather interrogated, depending on your definition.</p>
          
          <h3>What Sound/Music elements are Present?</h3>
          <p>The sound is essential to setting each scene. While the speakers give the listeners hints in their dialogue about where they are; the sound is what really paints the picture in the listeners mind of what the setting looks like and how the characters are behaving.</p>
